Jiatong Han is currently a year 3 undergraduate from the National University of Singapore. He majors in Computer Science and Mathematics and has focus areas on algorithm theories, distributed systems, and artificial intelligence. His career goal is to make everything intelligent and connected. During his third year in college, he did research under the supervision of Prof. Kan Min-Yen, on the topic of recommender systems. He proposed a novel graph-based recommender that handles user-item interaction effectively. In his spare time, he enjoys participating in hackathons and has won many prizes. Now he is actively looking for summer research opportunities starting from May 2022.
